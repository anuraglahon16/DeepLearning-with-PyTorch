Exercises & Assignments

# Weekly Assignments

Week 1: Linear Regression

Week 2: Image Classification

Week 3: Feedforward neural networks

# Course Project

For the course project, students will create an image classification model using Convolutional neural networks, on a real-world dataset of their choice. The project will allow students to experiment with different types of models and regularization techniques. Students will also present their work at the end of the course and publish a blog post describing their approach and results.

# Kaggle In-Class Competition

Students will participate in a private data science competition hosted on the Kaggle platform. The competition will run for 3 weeks, allowing students to apply & improve their skills in a competitive environment. Students will gain exposure to working with cloud GPU platforms.

# Certificate of Completion

Students who attend at least 5 out of 6 video lectures and make valid submissions for all assignments will be eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion by Jovian.ml. Selected projects will also be receive a Best Project Award based on evaluation criteria determined by the instructors.
